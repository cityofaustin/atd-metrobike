This repository contains a script which publishes Austin Metrobike trip data to our [public trip dataset](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Austin-MetroBike-Trips/tyfh-5r8s).

Metrobike staff upload trip records to a Dropbox folder on a monthly basis. This script fetches those files, transforms the records, and publishes them to the Open Data Portal (Socrata).
